    "<b>LCD pin 4: Register select</b> - This pin determines what we're passing to the character display. If it's set to LOW, the instruction register is selected for writing flags such as ones to clear the display and set the starting location. If it's set to HIGH, the data register is selected for reading and writing data to the display itself.\n",
